# **Model Card: HLP**
Inspired by [Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and [Lessons from Archives (Jo & Gebru)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10389.pdf), weâ€™re providing some accompanying information about the pre-trained HLP retriever.


### **Model Details**
Our HLP model was pre-trained on 20m DL and CM pseudo Q-P pairs extracted from Wikipedia graph. The details involved in training the HLP are described in the paper. We release two HLP checkpoints in our repository:
- The original version is trained on July 2021, using a old (at Dec 2020) DPR framework which we don't maintain anymore. 
- The lastest version is trained on March 2022, using the lastest DPR framework. Our repository use the lastest framework.

### **Model Date**
Old version: July 2021
New version: March 2022 (recommand@)


### **Training Data** (Pre-training)
We choose the snapshot 03-01-2021 of an English Wikipedia dump, and process it with [WikiExtractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor), resulting in over 22 million passages. We then extract 20 million pseudo Q-P pairs (10m dual-link and 10m co-mention) which our model is pre-trained on. More detail can be found in the Section 3 of our paper. We also release the training data and the processed Wikipedia graph in our homepage. Feel free to have a try.



### **Evaluation Data** (Downstream)

- **NQ/Trivia/WebQ** 
  - Source of [train/dev/test/corpus]: the [DPR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR) repository. <br>
  - Modification: For each sample, we only keep the top1 positive ctx and the top5 (hard) negative ctxs. 


- **HotpotQA** (full wiki)
  - Source of [train/dev/corpus]: [HotpotQA Homepage](https://hotpotqa.github.io/).  <br>
  - Modification: We use the negatives provided by [Path Retriever](https://github.com/AkariAsai/learning_to_retrieve_reasoning_paths) (Akari Asai et al. 2020).
